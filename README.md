# 🏦 Bank Loan Approval Prediction 💳📊

This project predicts whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on applicant details.  

Using **Python, Machine Learning, FastAPI, and Streamlit**, it builds a complete ML pipeline from data preprocessing to deployment.

**Workflow:**  
Data Collection → Data Cleaning → Feature Engineering → Model Training → API Development → Streamlit UI
